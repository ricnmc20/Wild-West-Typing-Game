# Wild-West-Typing-Game
Typing game that was created by me using Python and the Pygame library.

I created this game in order to increase my typing speed. I use it for five minutes before I start my studying every day. The user types words that appear under a target, and typing the word correctly fires the gun. Everytime a target is shot, the user gets a point and a new target/word appears. 

To try the game out yourself, import the Pygame library with Command Line and the run the typinggame.py in an interpretor of your choice.
